## Contribute to docs

Complete and accurate documentation is as important to a project as its code.

You don't need to know how to program to contribute to OSRlib! If you'd like to help out, whether you are a programming wizard or have never written a line of code, contributing to docs is *hugely* appreciated.

Edit existing docs, fix XML doc comments (triple-slash comments), add diagrams, art, or logos - it's **all welcome**!
