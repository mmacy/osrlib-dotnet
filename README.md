## What is OSRlib.NET?

The OSR library for .NET is a .NET Core assembly written in C# for use in the creation of turn-based RPGs in the old-school revival (OSR) style.

OSRlib.NET provides an object model representing well-known RPG entities like adventures, dungeons, beings (monsters and player characters), encounters, and weapons. It has an event-based interaction model for manipulating these entities, their relationships, and state.

The goals of the library:

- Easy to use
- Cross-platform
- Lightweight
- Event-driven
- Portable (decoupled from UI)
